                    Whales are mammals, so in many ways, they are just like human beings. The most important
                    difference
                    is that humans and whales live in different environments and whales have a special
                    respiratory
                    system that enables them to stay underwater for several minutes without breathing oxygen.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p>For this
                    reason, they are said to be voluntary breathers. That is, because of whales’ underwater
                    environment, they must be conscious breathers. They think about every breath they take
                    and come up
                    to the surface of the water to breathe through blowholes on top of their heads.

                    What is outstanding about whales is the way they can sleep. While all mammals sleep,
                    whales cannot
                    afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. The only way they can sleep
                    is by
                    remaining partially conscious. It is believed that only one hemisphere of the whale’s
                    brain sleeps
                    at a time, so they rest but are never completely asleep. They can do so most probably
                    near the
                    surface so that they can come up for air easily.

                    Many countries around the world celebrate Earth Day. It is a day that is meant to raise
                    awareness
                    and appreciation about the Earth’s natural environment.

                    The first Earth Day was held in the USA. It was founded by United States Senator Gaylord
                    Nelson as
                    an environmental teach-in – a sort of general educational forum or seminar. That was on
                    April 22,
                    1970.
                    While this first Earth Day was focused on the United States, an organization launched by
                    Denis
                    Hayes, who was the original national coordinator in 1970, took it international in 1990
                    and
                    organized events in 141 nations.

                    Earth Day is now coordinated globally by the Earth Day Network, and is celebrated in more
                    than 175
                    countries every year. Numerous communities celebrate Earth Week, an entire week of
                    activities
                    focused on environmental issues. In 2009, the United Nations designated April 22
                    International
                    Mother Earth Day.

                <p>The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was first built between
                    220–206
                    BC. In fact, it began as independent walls for different states when it was first built,
                    and did
                    not become the “Great” wall until the Qin Dynasty. Emperor Qin Shihuang succeeded in his
                    effort to
                    have the walls joined together to serve as fortification to protect the northern borders
                    of the
                    Chinese Empire from invasion. Afterwards it was rebuilt and maintained over the years,
                    between the
                    5th century BC and the 16th century.

                    One of the myths associated with the Great Wall of China is that it is the only man-made
                    structure
                    that can be seen from the Moon with the naked eye. The legend originated in Richard
                    Halliburton’s
                    1938 book Second Book of Marvels. However, this myth is simply not true. Richard
                    Halliburton’s
                    claim was contradicted by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Yang Liwei. A more plausible
                    assumption
                    would be to say that the Great Wall can be visible from a low orbit of the Earth which is
                    not
                    unique in this regard as many other artificial constructions can be seen from that
                    height.</p>

                    World Water Day is observed on March 22 since 1993. It was declared as such by the United
                    Nations
                    General Assembly. This day was first formally proposed in Agenda of the 1992 United
                    Nations
                    Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Observance
                    began in
                    1993 and has grown significantly ever since.

                    The UN and its member nations devote this day to implementing UN recommendations and
                    promoting
                    concrete activities within their countries regarding the world’s water resources. Each
                    year, one of
                    various UN agencies involved in water issues takes the lead in promoting and coordinating
                    international activities for World Water Day.

                    In addition to the UN member states, a number of NGOs promoting clean water and
                    sustainable aquatic
                    habitats have used World Day for Water as a time to focus public attention on the
                    critical water
                    issues of our era. Every three years since 1997, the World Water Council has drawn
                    thousands to
                    participate in its World Water Forum during the week of World Day for Water.
                    Participating agencies
                    and NGOs have highlighted issues such as a billion people being without access to safe
                    water for
                    drinking and the role of gender in family access to safe water.
